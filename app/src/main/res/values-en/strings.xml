    <string name="my_interests_text">My hobby is reading. I like to read books in my free time. I like funny stories, fairy tales, and poems for children. I like to read fairy tales very much. My favourite fairy tale is by Hans Christian Andersen. I have read it several times. Gerda is my favourite fairy-tale character. I usually read in the evening before sleep. I also like to read in a garden or in a park, sitting on a bench. Recently I began to read short stories in English. It is difficult for me to read in English. But I want to learn English, and I want to read books in English.</string>

             As a developer, you should always supply "one" and "other"
             strings. Your translators will know which strings are actually
             needed for their language. Always include %d in "one" because
             translators will need to use %d for languages where "one"
             doesn't mean 1 (as explained above).
